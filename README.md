## Welcome to my GitHub Pages

I'm a consultant with a love for data and programming, which I use in my daily job as a workforce management consultant. I love analysis, forecasting and modelling, specifically for contact centers. Call queue modelling, handling time distributions, customer abandonment behaviour, redialling callers, these subjects are all fair game.

I will write new posts very irregularly, so please except no particular updates on this blog.

Thanks for reading!
