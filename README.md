## Welcome to my GitHub Pages

I'm a geek with a love for data and programming, which I use in my daily job as a workforce management consultant. I love analysis, forecasting and modelling, specifically for contact centers. Calls queue modelling, handling time distributions, customer abandonment behaviour, redialling callers, these subjects are all fair game.
