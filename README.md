## Workforce Management Geeks

I'm a consultant with a love for data and programming, which I use in my daily job as a workforce management consultant. I'm interested in analysis, forecasting and modelling, specifically for contact centers. Call queue modelling, handling time distributions, customer abandonment behaviour, redialling callers, these subjects are all fair game.

I will write new posts very irregularly, so please expect no particular updates on this blog.

Thanks for reading!
